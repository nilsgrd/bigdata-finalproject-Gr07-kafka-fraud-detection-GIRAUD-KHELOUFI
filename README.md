# Real-Time Banking Transaction Fraud Detection with Kafka

## Project Overview
This project is a technical Big Data project developed as part of the **Big Data Introduction** course.
The objective is to design and run a minimal **real-time fraud detection pipeline** using **Apache Kafka**.

The system simulates banking transactions that are streamed in real time. A Kafka consumer processes these events and applies simple fraud detection rules to identify suspicious transactions.
